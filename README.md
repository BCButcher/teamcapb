Project 1 - Pokesim

Group Members: Alex, Brian, Chris

For this project we used PokeApi
Our initial idea was for a Pokedex, however since that would not have been enough of a challenge, we settled on doing a simple battle simulator.
The API is quite robust, organized, and easy to use. We were easily able to identify the stats we would need to grab from our returned Pokemon “objects” and even had sprites to work with.

Minimum Viable Product

Rudimentary battle system
6 Pokemon per team, randomly generated from API call
Pokemon sprites
Simple damage calculation 
Pokemon battle until one side runs out of usable team members

Current Features

Able to call over 600 Pokemon
Pokemon selection carousel with stat-display
Battle window, music
Sprites and numerous animations
Combat calculation that includes:
Global + || - 15% damage variance
Critical Chance
Special Attack damage && defense

Future Plans

Server side account / logins
Personal pokemon collection
A more Pokemon-like battle system (moves, abilities, type advantages, etc.)
Team builder (instead of randomly selected teams)
Storyline - Choose your own adventure might work well with this format so far
